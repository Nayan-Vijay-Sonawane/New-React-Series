Component:
- It is reusable piece of code that used to define certain part of user interface.
- Functional Component: easy to use and far better than class Component.
- Class Component: its old now and we have to use advance JS for that.(complex)

JSX:
- Its modern code for writing HTML and JS together.
- Browsers don't understand JSX so need to convert that into plain JS so Babel(compiler) comes in which converts that and renders also.
- and now we don't need to import the react library (before 17 we had to)
