Component:
- It is reusable piece of code that used to define certain part of user interface.
- Functional Component: easy to use and far better than class Component.
- Class Component: its old now and we have to use advance JS for that.(complex)

JSX:
- Its modern code for writing HTML and JS together.
- Browsers don't understand JSX so need to convert that into plain JS so Babel(compiler) comes in which converts that and
renders also.
- and now we don't need to import the react library (before 17 we had to)

Virtual DOM: 
- The Virtual DOM is an in-memory lightweight copy of the real DOM.
- When we update the UI, React doesn't touch the real DOM directly.
Instead, 1. Updates the virtual DOM first.
         2. Compares it with the previous virtual DOM snapshot(Diffing).
         3. Applies only the minimal required changes to the real DOM(reconciliation).

Explaination : 
React improves the UI performance using the concept called the Virtual DOM. Instead of updating the real DOM directly on
every change, React first updates an in-memory representation called the Virtual DOM. It then compares the new Virtual DOM
with the previous one using the diffing algorithm. Based on the differences, React efficiently updates only the changed parts
of the real DOM, this process is called reconciliation.
